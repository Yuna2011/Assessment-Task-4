**Need:**
To provide players with a calming and immersive experience to relieve themselves from their stress through exploration in a peaceful winter environment.

**Problem Statement:**
Many people experience stress, overstimulation or difficulty finding a moment of calm. This slow-paced exploration game set in a snowy landscape can promote relaxation as players gather firewood and light fires to stay warm.

**Skill Development:**
To develop the skills in Unity required to create the game, I would complete https://learn.unity.com/ and other tutorials from Youtube.
